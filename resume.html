    <p>Overall objective I have is 'world domination', which is not earth domination, in a good way through my development if possible. I am a proven software developer, who likes to grapple 
        with hard engineering problems that are difficult to solve. 
        Currently, my personal interests are programming techniques, software development tools, serverless computing, programming languages and a fusion of OOP and FP.
        Other random topics that interest me are as follows : UI/UX programming and Machine learning.

                In my spare time, I have dedicated myself to studying whatever I want to do as I wish, looking sunset beyond horizon with a cup of coffee or beer.

                                <br>The client needed to develop systems for customers to open Non-face-to-face bank account and then integrate those into their existing application service.
                                <br>They demanded it to be integrated as a type of iOS static library module including UI components and other resources, packaging API documentation all in one.
                                <br>This service required chatting(IRC), remote Control(VNC), VOIP video call services(SIP).
                                <br>Combining them into one, from scratch, I managed to design the iOS client software and API to interface with the existing app and develop those to make their requirements realized.
