    <p>
    My present objective is to create softwares that can change and improve world we live in.<br>

    <br>I am interested in Algorithm / DataStructure, Clean Code, OOP and Design Pattern, Functional Programming, Open-source, Compiler(LLVM).
    <br>Based on these cores, building infra-structure software between low-level and abstracted high-level software layer such as library, framework and SDK, exposing effectively-designed APIs (+ Backend Serverside Web API) for application software developer, is one of most interesting software type to me.<br>(Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch">Joshua Bloch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig">John Resig.</a> serious respect.)
    <br>(e.g. Foundation/UIKit, JDK, AFNetworking, JQuery, Java Spring framework and Firebase representatively.)
    <br>
    <br>Other random topics that interest me are: UI/UX Programming and Test Driven Development(TDD) and UNIX System programming.

        September 2011 - January 2013

        <p>This timeframe has included numerous technical and team achievements
            across a wide range of domains.  For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple shipped the Mac OS X 10.8 and iOS 6 releases, and they were
                built with Clang - llvm-gcc is obsolete, and GCC is long gone.</li>
            <li>We invested major effort into compiler implementation and tuning for
                the custom Apple CPU design known as the "<a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A6">Apple A6</a>".  The
                exceptional CPU performance of the iPhone 5 was a result of a joint effort
                between the Apple silicon and LLVM teams.</li>
            <li>I personally drove LLDB to production quality and to become the default
                debugger in Xcode.</li>
            <li>I drove the new "<a
                    href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.html">Objective-C
                Literal Syntax</a>" language extensions, making many common
                situations in Objective-C much more syntactically elegant.</li>
            <li>We shipped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#4.x_series">Xcode
                4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 releases</a>, and I was a key part of the high level
                feature planning and decision processes that defined the features and
                shaped the releases.</li>
        </ul><br>
    </li>

    <li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
        <b>Senior Manager and Architect, Low-Level Tools</b><br>
        June 2010 - September 2011

        <p>I managed the teams responsible for compilers, the LLDB debugger,
            Objective-C and C++ runtimes, assembler, linker, dynamic loader, etc.  I
            am continuing my work improving the Apple developer tools, and continue to
            contribute daily to the open source LLVM technologies.  During this time
            period my team switched Mac OS/X Lion and iOS5 to build with llvm-gcc and
            clang (off of GCC 4.2) and oversaw the final release of Xcode 4.0 in March
            (as well as subsequent updates).</p>
        <p>Xcode 4.2 was a specific achievement in that it is the first release where
            all of its compilers are LLVM-based (GCC 4.2 is no longer included).
            Xcode 4.2 also includes the "<a
                    href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">Automatic
                Reference Counting</a> (ARC) Objective-C language feature (see also
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting">wikipedia</a>).
            ARC has revolutionized Objective-C programming by automating memory
            management without the runtime overhead of a garbage collector.  I personally
            defined and drove this feature late in the schedule of iOS5 and Lion.  This
            is notable for the short schedule for the project, the extensive
            cross-functional work required, and the extensive backwards compatibility
            issues that had to be addressed (making it a very technically complex
            problem).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
        <b>Senior Manager of Compilers and Low-Level Tools, Compiler Architect</b><br>
        September 2009 - June 2010

        <p>My work in this time period culminated in the release of the Xcode 4 preview
            at WWDC, which included a preview release of Clang C++ support, a new <a
                    href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/">C++ Standard Library</a>, a much faster and
            memory efficient system linker, a <a
                    href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html">new X86
                assembler</a> (which is integrated into the clang compiler, providing faster
            compile times), and countless smaller improvements throughout the toolchain.</p>

        <p>Xcode 4 itself now features deep integration of the Clang parser for code
            completion, syntax highlighting, indexing, live warning and error messages,
            and the new 'Fix-It' feature in which the compiler informs the UI how to
            automatically corrects small errors.  LLVM-GCC is the default compiler in
            Xcode 4.</p>

        <p>The Xcode 4 preview also includes the first public release of <a
                href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> to which I served as a
            consultant and contributed directly to turning it into an open source
            project.</p>

        <p>In this time period, I was a second level manager running the teams responsible for
            <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>,
            <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>, <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>,
            and other parts of the Apple toolchain (assembler, linker, etc).  I directly
            managed the Clang team, contributed daily to both the Clang and LLVM projects,
            and continued in my role as compiler architect and lead on the Open Source
            LLVM/Clang projects.
        </p>

        <p>During this period my team brought Clang 1.0 to production quality as a
            brand new C and Objective-C compiler for X86-32 and X86-64.  We also
            productized and shipped the Xcode static analyzer, a new <a
                    href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt library</a>
            (which replaced libgcc in Snow Leopard) and many enhancements to existing
            components in the operating system.</p>

            We shipped llvm-gcc 4.2 in the Xcode 3.1 and major improvements for it in the
            Xcode 3.1.1 release.</p>

        <p>In addition to llvm-gcc, much of the work during this time was focused on
            Mac OS 10.6 development.  I made major contributions to design and
            implementation of the <a

<h3>Graduate School Work</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign<br>
        <b>Research Assistant</b><br>
        Fall 2000 - Spring 2005

        <p>
            I worked on numerous projects at UIUC, the most important being <A
                href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> and <a
                href="http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-05-04-LattnerPHDThesis.html">Data Structure
            Analysis</a> (DSA).  At Illinois, I designed and built most of the fundamental
            aspects of LLVM, establishing the architecture for things to come and building most
            of the scalar, loop and interprocedural optimizers.  I also built most of the
            target-independent code generator, X86 backend, JIT, llvm-gcc3 front-end, and
            much more.  Finally, I <a href="#pubs">wrote many papers</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        Microsoft Research: Programmer Productivity Research Center<br>
        <b>Research Intern</b><br>
        Summer 2004

        <p>
            I worked on the Microsoft Phoenix compiler infrastructure, building an
            experimental bridge between the Microsoft compiler and the LLVM compiler
            (which allowed LLVM to compile and run .NET code).
            In the process, I identified and fixed numerous bugs in the (still in
            early development) Microsoft compiler.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>IBM NUMA-Q / Sequent Computer Systems:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Operating Systems Group<br>
        <b>Software Engineer Contractor</b><br>
        May '00 - Aug '00

        <p>I virtualized the Linux Kernel to run as a user-level application under
            the Dynix/PTX operating system.  This provided 100% compatibility
            with existing Linux binaries, but this project was never productized.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        Compilers &amp; Tools Group<br>
        <b>Software Engineer Contractor</b><br>
        May '99 - Dec '99

        <p>I was involved with the 4.5 release of Sequent's PTX OS, which added
            kernel threads.  I was primarily involved porting the Java Virtual Machine
            from user-level threads to native threads, but was also drive debugged many
            kernel issues in the pthreads implementation.  I also added thread awareness
            to the system debugger.</p>

    <li>
        Operating Systems Group<br>
        <b>Software Engineer Intern</b><br>
        Jan '99 - Apr '99

        <p>I worked 16 hrs/wk developing an online remote kernel debugger based
            on GDB.</p>

    <li>
        Compilers &amp; Tools Group<br>
        <b>Software Engineer Intern</b><br>
        May-Aug, Dec '98

        <p>My primary work was to port Sun's Java Virtual Machine to the
            Dynix/PTX OS.  This involved work in both C &amp; Java, in systems as
            varied as user-level threads, garbage collection, and asynchronous
            I/O.</p>
</ul>
-->

<!--
<h3>Earlier Work Experience:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FEI Company<br>
<b>Software Engineer</b><br>
May-Aug, Dec '97

<p>I designed a system for integrating an optical microscope into an
  automated hard-drive head trimming application.  My work involved
  creating numerous C++ programs, communicating with various branches
  of FEI, and dealing with customers (both remote and on-site).</p>
  </li>

  <li> Cherokee Communications Corp<br>
  <b>Head of R&amp;D</b><br>
  Fall 1997 - 1999

  <p>Cherokee was a small start-up company where I lead the development of
  a sophisticated application for managing and tracking web page
  statistics.  Although Cherokee is now defunct, <a
	  href="http://nondot.org/MagicStats/">MagicStats</a> is still
  available under the GPL.</p>

  <li>Intel Corp<br>
  <b>Software Design Tester</b><br>
  May '96 - Aug '96

  <p>I tested applications and hardware for the (then unreleased) MMX
  product line.</p>

<h2><a name="books">Book Chapter</a></h2>

<p>In 2011, I wrote a chapter on LLVM for "<a
        href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source
    Applications</a>," a book on software design.  <a
        href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html">The chapter</a> describes
    traditional compiler design, what makes LLVM different, how
    library-based design impacts applicability of the code, and how some simple
    optimizations work.</p>


<h2><a name="pubs">Refereed Publications</a></h2>

<p>Since joining industry, I rarely take time to write papers about my
    work, preferring instead to focus on building new great things.  That
    said, LLVM is widely used as a basis for <a
            href="http://llvm.org/pubs/">many current and past research
        projects</a> by other people.</p>
