        with hard engineering problems that are difficult to solve. <br>
        Currently, my personal interests are programming techniques, software development tools, cloud computing(BaaS, FaaS/serverless), programming languages and a fusion of OOP and FP.<br>
        Other random topics that interest me are as follows : UI/UX programming and Machine learning.

                I am currently the founder of <a href="https://www.all-dayz.com" target="_blank">'ALL DAYZ' </a> at the same time I am a software freelancer who works in offline and online both depending on my mood and need, being often called a ditigal nomad programmer who travels anywhere while working enjoyably.<br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy to contribute to open source community <br> and dedicate myself to studying any topic of programming and Computer Science as I wish, looking sunset beyond horizon with a cup of coffee or beer near a beach.

                                I have been, on my own, trying to plan, design and develop a entire process of a software, called 'ALL DAYZ', implementing a majority of operating system platforms: iOS, Android and Web service all without any help at the same time I have been working as a self-employed freelancer software engineer who have consistently won a large number of contracts from diverse type of clients ranging from start-up company to conglomerates either by myself independently or via Wishket service, the most popular and accredited platform in South Korea, where businesses and professional individuals connect and collaborate remotely.<br>I finally released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/all-dayz-see-and-share/id1434294288?l=ko&ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">'ALL DAYZ iOS'</a> as well as <a href="https://all-dayz.com" target="_blank">'ALL DAYZ WEB'</a> in spite of being still in the very early stage of the product whilst Android is currently under development, 
                                I have used a wide range of technology and skill sets that I would have wanted to use here in the project freely under the hood.<br>Here are programming languages used for the project as follows: Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Javascript, Python and during which in terms of paradigm and software design architecture, I heavily seek Object-Oriented Programming paradigm while Functional Programming is deployed when considered necessary, based on the primary use of traditional MVC architecture, and a minor portion of MVVM pattern with Reactive programming.
                                <br>In addition, these are terms of either extensively or partially applied software technology in an applicative aspect: Server-less Cloud computing, BaaS(Backend as a Service), FaaS(Function As A Service), a NoSQL document database, as well as a relational database using SQL, Firebase, Web API oriented to Representational State Transfer (REST) and computer vision in artificial intelligence.
                                <br><br>(Mind it is still a very early development version!)

                            <br>Projects vary ranging from E-commerce targeting China market to education technology.

                    <li>This was a project for an iOS system integration framework that comprise a part of mobile chat, SIP voip call, VNC remote-control and all integration for those) used as a SDK for the Dongbu securities's opening Non-face-to-face bank account mobile application.
                        <br>The client needed to develop systems for customers to open Non-face-to-face bank account and then integrate those into their existing mobile application service.
                        <br>They demanded it to be integrated as a type of iOS static library module including UI components and other resources, packaging API documentation all in one.
                        <br>This service required chatting(IRC), remote Control(VNC), VOIP video call services(SIP).
                        <br>Combining them into one, from scratch, I managed to scheme the entire SDK and design APIs to interface with the existing app. 
                        <br>Not only that, I did write API documents necessary and was in charge of communication with industry software engineers who are going to use the SDK.

                    A visual impared person is not able to see the sight. this app helps volunteers to connect to the blind and they can call each other.<br>
                    In this situation, this iOS application is designed to help the blind to send the camera sight of visual impaired person's iPhone to a call partner's phone via either iPhone or an embedded device, interacting in bluetooth networking each other.<br>
                    Therefore, the callee can see the blind's sight while receiving video frame and can help them what the blind needs depening on where the blind direct the device camera by talking and instructing the blind.<br> 
                    I needed to tackle accessibility for the blind seriously as well in the project.
